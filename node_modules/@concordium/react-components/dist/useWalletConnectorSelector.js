/**
 * Hook for managing a connector selector (usually a button in the UI).
 *
 * More precisely, the hook computes the derived state {@link WalletConnectorSelector} from {@link props} as follows:
 * - The selector is {@link WalletConnectorSelector.isSelected selected} if the active connector's type is {@link connectorType}.
 * - The selector is {@link WalletConnectorSelector.isConnected connected} if it is selected and the active connection was created by the active connector.
 * - The selector is {@link WalletConnectorSelector.isDisabled disabled} if it there is another connected selector.
 *
 * It also exposes a {@link WalletConnectorSelector.select handler function} for connecting/disconnecting appropriately
 * when the selector is invoked.
 *
 * @param connectorType The connector type controlled by this selector.
 * @param connection The connection that, if present and originating from the selected connector, causes that connector to be considered "connected".
 * @param props The props exposed by {@link WithWalletConnector} to its child component.
 * @return The resolved state.
